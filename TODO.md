Known bugs: 
- A Button/text href for each album to show hidden track buttons for each correspondant album (now being shown)
- Transform numbers in song tags to text (0: zero, 1: one...)
- When album menu title names are clicked to show/hide the album songs and album cover
- Tooltip over emojis tags correctly triggers the animations
- Remember last playing track state on refresh (same way it's tracking the height of the page (?))
- going to the url afaces.tk/#plate or afaces.tk/plate do plays de song in the player.
- Click on Album image from navbar leads to page to move to the album position (#tagged) href
- Click on Track name from navbar leads to #tag of the song href
- href song onclick padding spacing extra because the navbar, the jumpline is covering and it jumps below than expected.
- Max volume of the song can be increased (?) vlc style
- üîù goes back to the top on the right sticky corner of the page and it shows at the low right page limit when enough scroll down is made
- Fix width of reproduction bar which makes no jumps of length when changing song
- Show text in marquee for long song names to avoid jumps of style transformations
- ‚ûï‚ûñ volume keys (not float, we want int here to control volume and being able to put it more loud like vlc)
- Change Menu theme icon to this custom emoji üéöÔ∏è 
- navbar-toggler-icon sticky on the right side of the screen and does not break jumpline
- volume slider incorrectly sized when web showing on a full display in PC view
- 'Buy on Bandcamp' and company menu items and time of the reproduction var number with a smaller font size style and properly shown in navbar menu

Go for:
- Create script to scrape names of tracks and orders of tracks from Spotify Playlists by URL
- Give a custom style to contact form
- Create custom playlist substitutor system using Afaces number's playlists (+ Temazos de Afaces) and use it to effectively
change the actual playlist in the main player.
- Trigger song listening in song titles in main player.
- Trigger display of the buttons of the songs individual audioplayer the tracks of the album when album title (href??) is clicked
- Create basic contact section style for the page
- - button ‚ùá add the song to the playlist ‚ú¥ takes it out to mantain a local playlist and is used to create new playlists and also indicates the selected current playlist
- ‚ú≥Ô∏èbutton is shown to indicate that the track is present in the selected playlist, ‚ú¥ takes it out of the selected playlist
- Button ‚èπ Pauses all playlist or track playing and gets back to the start of the actual playing track it is placed under div buttons 
- Checkbox in contact section to enable email contact saving in a private storage

- Animation:
- When the button of the song is played the emoji changes to ‚èÆ, when this same button is pressed again music goes back to the beggining of the track 
and then it hides the music player controls of the song and the emoji, then button turns back to the original one and if it being pressed again and back to normal and it show the correct music player and the buttons...
- Button for each album to Show/Hide all album related songs buttons 
- Playing a song directly in the controller changes the emoji to ‚èÆ (meaning that the button is pressed the song will go back to the beginning which is what happens)
- Pressing the ‚èÆ will show correspondant emojis of action for the selected song.
- Sound bar hopefully similar sync to the actual audio controls live in sort of <div> in .md to play the global playlist management showing the track duration and actual point of reproduction, the current name of the track and in the time emoji button tracking of the music streaming flux of the songs.
